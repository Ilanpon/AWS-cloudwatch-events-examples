# AWS example events
The documentation and examples in AWS lack a lot, if not most, examples of useful events so I will be throwing them here as I come across them. 

# Usage
These are mainly for building Lambda functions. The test cases in the lambda configuration are lacking and sometimes outright incorrect.
